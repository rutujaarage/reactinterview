        what is react?
        <li>React is a open source frontend js library,</li>
        <li> React was created by jardane walke, a software engineer at  facebook in the year 2011 and it was deployed  first at the facebook newsfeed and later it was used in facebook and instagram.  it follows the component based approach for building reusable UI component specially for single page pplication </li>
        <li>and it is used for developing  intractive view layer of web and mobile application .</li>
        <ul>
            <li>virtual dom </li>
            <li>one way data binding</li>
            <li>reusable component</li>
            <li>Jsx (javascript syntax extension </li>
            <li>Performance</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Explain Virtual Dom</li>
        <li>Dom=> dom stand for document object model and this represent the logical structure of document . Whenever our js is loaded in the broswer</li>
        <li>DOM is a document object model, created by converting HTML CSS and JS Real DOM, which is an object which gets created whenever any React application gets loaded on the screen for the first time., whenever React components gets mounted on the screen for the first time. Now when any user makes any changes on the screen like button click because of which the state variable will get updated so in this case the changes will not directly go to Real DOM , instead in react we have concept known Virtual DOM. So we are having two virtual doms, one virtual dom gets created at the time of mounting of react component so it is a copy of your real dom.</li>
             <li>Another virtual dom is the dom which contains the new changes, updated state variables values. Now these two virtual doms will get compared with each other and will check for the new changes. this complete procedure is known as diffing algorithm.</li>
        <li>Now the new changes will be updated in your Real dom. this procedure is known as Recoinciliation.</li>
             
        <li>diffing algorithm</li>
        <li>react is a libabary</li>
        <li> library is a set of reusable function used by computer programs <li> code call in library</li> in library we can not contorl the dta flow by method </li>
        <li>freamwork it is pease of code dicates the architecture pf a project, framwork call the code ,we dpont have control of the data floow , freamwork desided how data awill flow that is nothing but framework calls a code </li>
        <li></li>
        <ul>function component and class component difference==>
            <li>class component havin react lifecycles </li> <li>function component having hooks</li>
        <li>stateful component are class component</li>  <li>it having stateless component</li>
        <li> c component having render</li>         <li>function component having return </li>
        <li> prop and state accepted in C C </li>                <li>F C accept props as a argument </li>
        <li>they having complex code and hard to write</li> <li>it easy to read  they having less code</li>
        <li>in c c we having to use this keyword </li> <li>function c we dont eed to this keyword</li>
        </ul>
<br>
<br>

        <ul>
            stateful and stateless ==>
            <li>stateless c does not hold or manage state and stateful can hold and amnage the state </li>
            <li>stateles is easy to understand but stateful component it is complex as compare to the stateless component</li>
            <li>stateless c does not work with react lifecycles but stateful c work lifecycyle methods</li>
            <li>stateless can not bbe reused while can be used in case of stateful c.</li>
            <li>stateless com is also known as function component and stateful is class c </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>what sre the diffrent phases of react component lifecycles
            <li>1.mounting 2.unmounting 3.upadting 4. </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
